<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a researcher, data analyst, and graduate student at Northeastern University
  studying networks and complex systems. My primary academic interest is the 
  long-term structural evolution of large-scale human social systems.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not engaged in research, reading, coursework, or anxious rumination 
  (rare these days), I enjoy playing drums, snowboarding, and anything to do 
  with sci-fi.

<h3>"What is a complex system anyway?"</h3>
<p>
  Complex systems are collections of components that self-organize into a 
  greater, cohesive "whole" despite lacking centralized direction. Check out
