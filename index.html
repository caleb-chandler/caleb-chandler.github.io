# About Me
I am a researcher, data analyst, and graduate student at Northeastern University
studying networks and complex systems. My primary academic interest is the 
long-term structural evolution of large-scale human social systems.

When I'm not engaged in research, reading, coursework, or anxious rumination 
(rare these days), I enjoy playing drums, snowboarding, and anything to do 
with sci-fi.

### "What is a complex system anyway?"
Complex systems are collections of components that self-organize into a 
greater, cohesive "whole" despite lacking centralized direction. Check out
