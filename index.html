  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a researcher, data analyst, and graduate student at Northeastern University
    studying networks and complex systems. My primary academic interest is the
    long-term structural evolution of large-scale human social systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not engaged in research, reading, coursework, or anxious rumination
    (rare these days), I enjoy playing drums, snowboarding, and anything to do
    with sci-fi.

  <h2>"What is a complex system anyway?"</h2>
  <p>
    Complex systems are collections of components that self-organize into a
    greater, cohesive "whole" despite lacking centralized direction. Check out
